This README was human-generated, AI-enhanced, and then human-adjusted.
Loader and Google icons are from react-icons.

I used AI to do 3 things: 
- Help me debug(I'm new to typescript). Claude was very good with vercel errors!

- Get the tts api request working(I didn't know whether I needed a node server or I should use API routes).

- Help me resolve some errors(npm issues and incompatibility)

PS: if anyone has a good book suggestion or video course for typescript? I keep running into errors and they take forever to fix...
