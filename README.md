# Ayaan Grobot 

I made this project as a web-version of my Discord bot, Ayaan Grobot. It was made with Groq AI, which is not only fast but also free(so far). I coded it in HTML/JS/CSS but later upgraded it to Next.js. Unfortunately, my next.js site was on my laptop which crashed before I could commit it to github. I tried to replicate the original site on my chromebook, but it just looked ugly. Eventually I returned to the HTML/JS/CSS site. It will not be accessable right now because it has my API Keys in it. However, it has google login, and each user has their chats stored in firebase. Right now you can only have one chat, but I'm planning to add the ability to make more chats soon!
