# Ayaan Grobot 

Ayaan Grobot was made with Groq AI, which is not only fast but also free(so far) and uses Llama3. I coded it in HTML/JS/CSS but later moved it to Next.js. It has google login with firebase, and each user has their chats stored in firestore.

Need help? Email [ayaangrobot-aaaaowlmjut7p3xbifcpxxhxny@hackclub.slack.com](mailto:ayaangrobot-aaaaowlmjut7p3xbifcpxxhxny@hackclub.slack.com)! We'll (usually) respond within hours.

I used AI to do 3 things: help me debug(I'm new to typescript), get the tts api request working(I didn't know whether I needed a node server or I should use API routes), and help me resolve some errors(npm issues and incompatibility)
